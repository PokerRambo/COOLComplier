This repo is used to record my progress in Stanford CS143 compiler.

2018-11-07 Lexer finished! Full Score(63/63).

Attention: Before making your lexer, delete c-syntax block comment in rules section, or it will prompt "Unrecognized rule ..." ERROR, and do not leave blank lines which will cause some trouble locating errors.

Advice: Test-driven development is strongly recommended for this assignment!
